GitHub Actions gives you the flexibility to build an automated software development lifecycle workflow. You can write individual tasks, called actions, and combine them to create a custom workflow. Workflows are custom automated processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any code project on GitHub.

With GitHub Actions you can build end-to-end continuous integration and continuous deployment capabilities directly in your repository. GitHub Actions powers GitHub's built-in continuous integration (CI) service. For more information, see "About continuous integration."

Workflows run in Linux, macOS, Windows, and containers on GitHub-hosted servers. You can create workflows using actions defined in your repository, open source actions in a public repository on GitHub, or a published Docker container image. Workflows in forked repositories don't run by default.

You can discover actions to use in your workflow on GitHub and build actions to share with the GitHub community. For more information on creating a custom action, see "Building actions."

You can create a workflow file configured to run on specific events. For more information, see "Configuring a workflow" and "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions".
